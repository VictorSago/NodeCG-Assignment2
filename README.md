# Express.js Server

## Following a tutorial on Node.js

Second assignment in the Node.js tutorial. Creating an Express.js server.

1. Create a nom project and install Express.js and (optionally) nodemon.
2. Create an Express.js app which funnels the requests through 2 middleware functions that log something to the console and return one response.
3. Handle requests to `/` and `/users` such that each request only has one handler/middleware that does womething with it (e.g. send dummy response).
